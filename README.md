# LRCM: Enhancing Adversarial Purification through Latent Representation Compression
1. Run `atk_cifar10.py` to create adversarial examples.
2. Run `lxt_main.py` to train and evaluate the LRCM.
3. Download cifar-10 dataset: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
4. You need to prepare a pre-trained model named `./models/res18-cifar10` and create a file named `./accuracy/res18_verify.txt` to record the validation results of the trained model.
